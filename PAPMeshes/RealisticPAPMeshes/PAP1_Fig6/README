This folder contains the realistic perisynaptic astrocytic process meshes created in Fig 6 of the below study:

Denizot, A.; Veloz Castillo, M. F.; Puchenkov, P.; Cali, C.; De Schutter, E. (2022). The endoplasmic reticulum in perisynaptic astrocytic processes: shape, distribution and effect on calcium activity. DOI: 10.1101/2022.02.28.482292

'data_PAP1vz.csv' contains the main geometrical features of the ER in each PAP mesh: surface area (s_er, μm2), volume (v_cyt, μm3), er surface/cytosol volume ratio (svr_er, μm-1) and the number of ER vertexes at ER-PM contact sites (ERPM_contpt_ER).

'PAP1_original' folder contains the original PAP1 mesh, before ER was scaled up or down to create meshes PAP1v-z.

The other folders contain the PAP1v-z meshes presented in Fig6. They contain meshes in .stl and .msh format, a text file with distances between each PM vertex and the closest ER vertex, as well as a screenshot of the mesh (prior to joining ER objects and applying boolean difference between the PAP and ER objects, see M&M of the paper for details).
