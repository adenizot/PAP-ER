Meshes are divided into 2 main categories:
- PAP meshes extracted from electron microscopy, provided in the 'EMPAPMeshes' folder, presented in Fig4-5 of the paper.
- realistic PAP meshes created based on PAP meshes from electron microscopy, in the 'RealisticPAPMeshes folder, presented in Fig6 and Fig9 of the paper.
