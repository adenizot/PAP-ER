This folder contains the code used to perform geometrical analysis of the meshes created in the below study:

Denizot, A.; Veloz Castillo, M. F.; Puchenkov, P.; Cali, C.; De Schutter, E. (2025). The ultrastructural properties of the endoplasmic reticulum govern microdomain signaling in perisynaptic astrocytic processes. DOI: 10.1101/2022.02.28.482292

The 'geometry_analysis.py' script was used to measure PM-PSD, ER-PSD and ER-PM distances presented in Fig. 1 and 2 of the paper.

The blender file of the PAP mesh 'd1s15a32b1.blend' is provided as an example. If you run the code, it will create files containing:
- distances between each PM vertex and the center of mass of the post-synaptic density 
- distances between each ER vertex and the center of mass of the post-synaptic density 
- distances between each PM vertex and the closest ER vertex 

# Note: distances are expressed in micrometers
