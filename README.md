# PAP-ER
This is the repository that contains the code associated with the paper below:

Denizot, A.; Veloz Castillo, M. F.; Puchenkov, P.; Cali, C.; De Schutter, E. (2022). The endoplasmic reticulum in perisynaptic astrocytic processes: shape, distribution and effect on calcium activity. DOI: 10.1101/2022.02.28.482292

Files are organized within different folders, as follows:
- 'Ca2+Model' contains the simulation code used in Fig 4, 5, 6 and 9 of the paper
- 'GeometryAnalysis' contains the analysis code used in Fig 2, 3 and 7 to measure PM-PSD, ER-PSD or ER-PM distances
- 'PAPMeshGeneration' contains the algorithm that allows the generation of realistic PAP meshes with various ER distributions in the PAP, with constant ER and PAP shape

Datasets will be uploaded online upon paper acceptance and will be organized as follows:
- 'PAPMeshes' contains the perisynaptic astrocytic meshes used in this study
- 'TripartiteSynapseMeshes' contains the tripartite synapse meshes used in this study
