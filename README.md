This is the repository that contains the datasets and code associated with the paper below:

Denizot, A.; Veloz Castillo, M. F.; Puchenkov, P.; Cali, C.; De Schutter, E. (2022). The endoplasmic reticulum in perisynaptic astrocytic processes: shape, distribution and effect on calcium activity. DOI: 10.1101/2022.02.28.482292

Data and code are organized within different folders, as follows:
- 'Ca2+Model' contains the simulation code used in Fig 4, 5, 6 and 9 of the paper
- 'GeometryAnalysis' contains the analysis code used in Fig 2, 3 and 7 to measure PM-PSD, ER-PSD or ER-PM distances
- 'PAPMeshes' contains the perisynaptic astrocytic meshes used in this study
- 'PAPMeshGeneration' contains the algorithm that allows the generation of realistic PAP meshes with various ER distributions in the PAP, with constant ER and PAP shape
- 'TripartiteSynapseMeshes' contains the tripartite synapse meshes used in this study
