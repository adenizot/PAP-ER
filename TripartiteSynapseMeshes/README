This folder contains the 28 fully reconstructed tripartite synapse meshes created in the below study:
Denizot, A.; Veloz Castillo, M. F.; Puchenkov, P.; Cali, C.; De Schutter, E. (2022). The endoplasmic reticulum in perisynaptic astrocytic processes: shape, distribution and effect on calcium activity. DOI: 10.1101/2022.02.28.482292

The file 'data_synapses.csv' contains the main geometrical features of each mesh: surface area (surf, μm2), volume (vol, μm3) and surface-volume ratio (svr, μm-1) of the spine, the bouton and the perisynaptic process (PAP) of each mesh. 
'minPMPSD' corresponds to the minimum distance between vertexes on the plasma membrane of the PAP and the center of mass of the PSD. 
'er_pres' is 'ER' if the PAP contains some ER, 'noER' otherwise. 
In meshes where ER was present, the following analysis was performed:
ER surface area (er_surf, μm2), volume (er_vol, μm3), ER surface-volume ratio (er_svr, μm-1), ER surface/PAP volume ratio (erpap_svr, μm-1), minimum distance between the ER and the center of mass of the post-synaptic density (min_erpsd, μm), PM (erpmc_pmsurf, μm2) and ER (erpmc_ersurf, μm2) surface area at ER-PM contact sites (distance <= 20 nm), minimum ER-PM distance (min_erpm_dist, μm) and mean ER-PM distance (mean_erpmd, μm).

The folder 'meshes' contains Blender files of each of the 28 meshes, with the spine (blue), the bouton (grey), the post-synaptic density (red), the perisyaptic astrocytic process (green) and the astrocytic ER (if present, yellow).
